# 🧠 Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship Program**. It demonstrates how to implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification using both **Linear** and **RBF** kernels.

## 📊 Dataset Used
- 📦 **Breast Cancer Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
- 🎯 **Goal**: Classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign**

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Train SVM models with:
  - 🧮 Linear kernel
  - 🔁 RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel
- 🛠 Tune hyperparameters: `C` and `gamma`
- 📈 Evaluate using metrics and cross-validation
- 📐 (Optional) Visualize decision boundaries on 2D data

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- 🐍 Python
- 📚 Scikit-learn
- 🔢 NumPy
- 📉 Matplotlib
- 🌈 Seaborn

---

## 🚀 Steps Followed
1. 📥 Loaded the dataset
2. 🧹 Preprocessed and scaled the features
3. 🧠 Trained SVM models (Linear & RBF)
4. 🧪 Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
5. 🔍 Tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV
6. 🔁 Used cross-validation to verify performance

---

## 📌 Results
- 🟢 High accuracy for both linear and RBF models
- 🧪 Best parameters found via grid search
